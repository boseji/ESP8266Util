= ESP8266Util library for ESP8266 Arduino =

== Useful common utility functions for ESP8266 Module & Thingspeak ==

This library was developed in the spirit help perform common functions
while working with ESP8266 module faster.
Also some of the IoT usecases need cloud access, we like the 
[Thingspeak](http://www.thingspeak.com) IoT service.
Hence this library has a set of Basic APIs to talk to the *Thingspeak Services*.


Hence needs initialization of the *Serial* Library before 
with `Serial.begin(115200);`. 

(Note: In general for ESP8266 115200 BAUD a preferred BAUD rate.)


== Example ==

```arduino
#include <ESP8266Util.h>

const char *ssid = "..........";
const char *password = "...........";

void setup() {
  // Boot-up Wait
  delay(100);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println();
  
  // WiFi Connection
  if(Connect(ssid,password,50))
    Serial.println(" Connected");
  else
  {
    Serial.println(" Error Unable to connect");
    while(1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```


=== Dependencies ===
 *Serial* Library
 Thread Safe: No
 Extendable: Yes

 
===== Note: =====
**Debug Serial Print can be Disabled** by making 
`#define NoDebug 1` on *Line 36* of `src/ESP8266Util.cpp`.
